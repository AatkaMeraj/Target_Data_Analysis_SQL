🔍 Key Insights & Recommendations

1️⃣ Seasonality & Festive Offers

No seasonality was observed in 2018, likely due to a lack of festive shopping offers.

Recommendation: Introduce attractive seasonal promotions to boost sales.

2️⃣ Customer Demographics & Market Expansion

Nearly two-thirds of customers come from just three states.

Recommendation: Expand marketing efforts in other states to increase customer reach.

3️⃣ Off-Peak Shopping Trends

Very few people shop late at night.

Recommendation: Implement late-night discounts or promotions to drive sales during off-peak hours.

4️⃣ Delivery Time & Customer Experience

The average delay between estimated and actual delivery is 8–20 days.

Recommendation: Improve logistics and supply chain efficiency to ensure faster and more predictable deliveries.

5️⃣ Freight Cost Optimization

Some states (RR and PB) have high freight costs.

Recommendation: Optimize logistics and routing strategies to reduce operational expenses.

6️⃣ Delivery Time Performance

The longest average delivery time is 28 days, which is too high.

Recommendation: Reduce delivery times to enhance customer satisfaction and retention.
